# World-Happiness-Report

As a global society, we are waking up to the fact that happiness in our daily lives is extremely important. The positive effects of a balanced mind spread not only throughout a person's life, but also throughout society in a stone-in-the-pond figure of speech.
The World Happiness Report is a publication of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, powered by data from the Gallup World Poll and Lloyd’s Register Foundation, who provided access to the World Risk Poll.
The purpose of this project is to dive in and analyse the happiness score per country around the world and the main characteristics of what forms “Happiness”.

# Learning Objectives

4. Freedom to produce life decisions
5. Generosity
6. Perceptions of corruption
